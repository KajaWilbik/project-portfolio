            <p>This is where you sell in your new self. You're happy to combine your previous experience with your new frontend skills or basically use this are to describe yourself the way you see your role in the future. Either you do something like "Frontend + design" or more of a sentence like; "Frontend developer with a background in communications". Or if you don't see yourself as a frontend developer in the future maybe you want to write something like; "Project manager with coding skills". It's your portfolio.
